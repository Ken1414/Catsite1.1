*I made changes to css,html based on the previous Catsite 1.0.
At that time, I did not make a copy of the initial data, so I created a new repository.
The functionality is the same, but I will include the changes.


## **Introduction**

Since it is created using Django and python, you need to activate the server to start the browser.<br>
Once activated, you will probably be able to access it from the default port 8000.<br>

After preparing a video record of synthesia like the image above,<br>

please follow the steps and

⑴ Specify the video path in files<br>

⑵ (from top to bottom)<br>
 * File name (including .mp4)<br>
 * First note (A0 to C9 on the leftmost keyboard)<br>
 * Song tempo (3-digit BPM)<br>
 * Start time (time to cut until notes touch)<br>
 * Keyboard color (from RGB)
 <br>
 Enter and click the "Run" button on the left.
 At this time, the button on the right resets the input value. Be careful not to operate incorrectly.
<br>
<br>
⑶ After a few seconds, the results will be displayed within the frame.<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Revisions**
We made major changes to css and changed the site description to English.

<br>
Also, since it cannot process complex or long videos, we have pre-stored one video data named "test2.mp4" for demo purposes. This is also included in this repository, so be careful with space.
